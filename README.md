# TwiceWebpage
A mock website for the kpop girl group Twice coded with HTML and CSS. Includes a home, store, and about page. Although there are many buttons, the only buttons that actually work are the social media links at the bottom right of the footer, the home, store, and about buttons on the nav at the top, and finally the big play button under the name TWICE on the home page. This final button will play their new single The Feels from an MP3 file.
